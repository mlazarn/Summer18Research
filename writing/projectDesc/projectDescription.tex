\begin{document}
We have been studying the boundary effects between two different models for cyclic
competition of three species (namely the Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) and May-Leonard
(ML) models) on the formation of noise-induced and -stabilized patterns. Using 
Monte-Carlo simulations, we observed a disruption of the spiral waves which are 
typically dominant in the ML model in the form of plane waves eminating from the 
RPS region. We have also observed a marked drop in overall population density 
near the interface between the two regions. We will continue to characterize these
effects and use this information to develop methods of external control over the 
pattern formation in these systems.
