# Summer 2018 ARO Research

This repository is here to store and manage my work on the
Shannon Serrao's research (Funded by the ARO, PI's Uwe TÃ¤uber
and Michel Pleimling). 

## Monte Carlo Simulation.
This directory will contain code for a Monte Carlo simulation of the May-Leonard
model. One of the main goals of the code is to be easily extensible via inheritance
and polymorphism, enabling fast and efficient testing of various control schema.
