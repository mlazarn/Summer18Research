# Summer 2018 ARO Research

This repository is here to store and manage my work on the
research I performed at Virginia Tech under the supervision of
Dr. Shannon Serrao and Professer Uwe TÃ¤uber (funded by the Army Research Office).
This research began as part of the 2018 ARO Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship
Program (URAP). 

## Monte Carlo Simulation.
This directory will contain code for a Monte Carlo simulation of the May-Leonard
model. One of the main goals of the code is to be easily extensible via inheritance
and polymorphism, enabling fast and efficient testing of various control schema. It 
also includes visualisation/analysis/automation scripts, jupyter notebooks used for
testing/experimentation, and some figures.

## Writing
This directory includes writing produced over the course of this research, including
the slides I presented in the form of a contributed talk at the 2019 APS March Meeting.
